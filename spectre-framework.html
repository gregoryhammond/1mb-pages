            <p>Spectre.css says it's a "lightweight, responsive, and modern CSS framework". It says it's also 10kB when gzipped and it's flexbox-based. The first version was <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/spectre.css/v/0.1.1">published to npm in April 2016</a>, and has had updates since.
            <br> <br>
            In the <a href="https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre#browser-support">Github repo readme</a>, it says that they try to "make most styles compatible with earlier browsers", but it is designed for modern browsers. They have recommend the last 4 versions of Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Opera. As well as the extended support release of Firefox, as well as Internet Explorer version 10 or above.
