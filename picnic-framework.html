          <!-- In the documentation for grids(https://picnicss.com/documentation#grids), it tells you to use div then span for each column, but when I did that it moved this first p to the right and moved the 2nd p over to the left bottom side. -->
          There is very little information about Picnic CSS other than what is already on their <a href="https://github.com/franciscop/picnic">github repo</a> or <a href="https://picnicss.com/">their website</a>.
          <br> <br>
          The repo doesn't even contain the very first release, it starts at <a href="https://github.com/franciscop/picnic/releases/tag/v3.0">version 3.0</a> which was released on Febuary 4th 2015. The releases don't even contain the .css file that is the framework, you would either need to download the entire source code or use a CDN that lets you point to an old version. </p>
          <p>The idea for this came from <a href="https://1mb.club/">1MB Club</a>.
            My challenge is to make a number of webpages that are 1MB or less in size. I will be creating a number of different pages in different ways.</p>
